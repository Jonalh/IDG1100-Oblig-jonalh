            <li>Assign it to a txt file: >> /home/example1.txt</li>
            <li>The line will look like this: 30 * 16 11 *      echo "Task scheduled at $(date)" >> /home/example1.txt</li>
            <li>Navigate to /home, and touch a file named example1.txt</li>

        <h3>25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question. Thes cript should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. The
        menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again,or no changes is made if the
        user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the menu. Each option in the menu
        should lead to an echo of the answer</h3>
