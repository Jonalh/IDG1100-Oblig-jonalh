24. Create a step by step tutorial on how to create a cronjob that prints “Task scheduled at” + DATE. Cronjob is scheduled every 30 minutes on today’s date (only today).

	1. Write crontab -e to edit the cron job

	9. Cat the example1.txt file to view the output

25. Create a script that takes an input (letter or number) that will display the answer of a question. The script should when started list a menu for the user with the different questions that can be chosen and which corresponding letter the user will have to give as input to display the answer of the desired question. One of the possible inputs the user should be able to make is "q" for quitting the script. The menu should also have a default case where all the items is displayed again, or no changes is made if the user gives an invalid input. Hint: use a switch case to be able to handle the menu. Each option in the menu should lead to an echo of the answer

#!/bin/bash
clear
while [ "$ANSWER" != "1" ] || [ "$ANSWER" != "2" ] ||  [ "$ANSWER" != "3" ] ||  [ "$ANSWER" != "4" ] ||  [ "$ANSWER" != "5" ] ||  [ "$ANSWER" != "q" ]
do

echo "Hello, this is a list of question"
echo "Enter q to exit the script"

echo ""

echo "1. Who is the president of The United States?"
